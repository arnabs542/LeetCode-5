-- Select all employee's name and bonus whose bonus is < 1000.
-- As the result should also contain NULL's for records that doesn't exist in the bonus table, left join is needed
SELECT
emp.name, bon.bonus
FROM employee emp
LEFT JOIN bonus bon
ON emp.empId = bon.empId
WHERE bon.bonus IS NULL OR bon.bonus < 1000;

-- Method 2: similar approach as above but instead of null filters, use COALESCE
SELECT
emp.name, bon.bonus
FROM employee emp
LEFT JOIN bonus bon
ON emp.empId = bon.empId
WHERE COALESCE(bon.bonus, 0) < 1000;
