-- Write an SQL query that reports the most experienced employees in each project. In case of a tie, report all employees with the maximum number of experience years.
-- method 1: using window functions: submit using oracle server on LC
select sub.project_id, sub.employee_id
from (select p.project_id, p.employee_id, e.experience_years, dense_rank() over(partition by project_id order by experience_years desc) as 'rank'
      from Project p
      left join Employee e
      on p.employee_id = e.employee_id) as sub
where sub.rank = 1;

-- method 2: using correlated sub query: MySQL
