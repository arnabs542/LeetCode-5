-- write a SQL query to find all numbers that appear at least three times consecutively.
-- uses cross join. this only works if there are no gaps in the id's (all id's should be consecutive)

SELECT distinct(l1.num) as ConsecutiveNums
FROM logs l1, logs l2, logs l3
WHERE (l1.id = l2.id +1) AND (l2.id=l3.id+1) AND (l1.num = l2.num) AND (l2.num = l3.num);
