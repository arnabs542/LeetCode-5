-- Write a SQL query to get the nth highest salary from the Employee table.
-- method 1: using correlated sub query
CREATE FUNCTION getNthHighestSalary(N INT) RETURNS INT
BEGIN
RETURN (
select distinct e1.salary from employee e1 where N-1 = (select count(distinct(salary)) from employee e2 where e1.salary < e2.salary)
);
END

-- method 2: using limit and offset
CREATE FUNCTION getNthHighestSalary(N INT) RETURNS INT
BEGIN
DECLARE M INT;
SET M=N-1;
  RETURN (
      select distinct(salary) from employee order by salary desc limit M,1

  );
END

-- method 3: using window functions: doesn't execute in workbench though
CREATE FUNCTION getNthHighestSalary(N INT) RETURNS INT
BEGIN
  RETURN (
     select distinct(salary)
from

select salary, dense_rank() over (order by Salary desc) as Rank
