-- Write an SQL query to find all active businesses.
-- Method 1:
select business_id
from (select e.business_id
      from events e
      join (select event_type, avg(occurences) as 'avg'
            from events
            group by event_type) as sub
       on e.event_type=sub.event_type
       where e.occurences > sub.avg) as sub2
       group by business_id
       having count(*) > 1;

-- Method 2:  Simpler way of writing method 1
select e.business_id
from events e
join (select event_type, avg(occurences) as 'avg'
      from events
      group by event_type) as sub
on e.event_type = sub.event_type
where e.occurences > sub.avg
group by e.business_id
having count(*)>1;
