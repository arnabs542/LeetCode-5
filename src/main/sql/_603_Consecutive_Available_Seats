-- Several friends at a cinema ticket office would like to reserve consecutive available seats.
-- Can you help to query all the consecutive available seats order by the seat_id using the following cinema table?
SELECT DISTINCT c1.seat_id
FROM cinema c1 JOIN cinema c2
ON c1.seat_id = c2.seat_id + 1
OR c2.seat_id = c1.seat_id +1
WHERE c1.free = 1 AND c2.free=1
ORDER BY c1.seat_id;
