-- Method 1: using the correlated sub query approach: sub query executes for each iteration of the outer loop
SELECT s1.score,
(SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(score)) FROM scores s2 WHERE s2.score>=s1.score) AS 'Rank'
FROM scores s1
ORDER BY s1.score DESC;


-- Alternate Methods: can also be pursued using window functions
select Score, dense_rank() over (order by Score desc) as 'Rank'
from scores;
