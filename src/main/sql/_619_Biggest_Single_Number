-- Table my_numbers contains many numbers in column num including duplicated ones. Can you write a SQL query to find the biggest number, which only appears once.
-- the only tricky thing is to handle the case where the num is null. for that use outer query
select (select num
from my_numbers
group by num
having count(*) = 1
order by num desc limit 1) as num;

-- alternate method: different way to handle null
select max(sub.num) as num
from (select num
from my_numbers
group by num
having count(*) = 1
order by num desc limit 1) as sub;
