## Method: 1
select max(salary) as SecondHighestSalary
from employee
where salary not in
(select max(salary) from employee);

## Method: 2
select distinct(salary) as SecondHighestSalary
from employee
order by salary desc
limit 1, 1;

## Method: 3: using correlated sub query approach, see: geeksforgeeks.org/sql-correlated-subqueries/
select e1.salary as SecondHighestSalary
from employee e1 where 1=
              (select count(distinct(salary))
              from employee e2
              where e2.salary>=e1.salary)
