-- Write a sql to find the name of the winning candidate
-- Method 1: Using temp table and a join
SELECT Name
FROM Candidate t1
JOIN
(SELECT CandidateId, COUNT(*) AS max_count FROM Vote GROUP BY CandidateId ORDER BY max_count DESC limit 1) AS t2
ON t1.id = t2.CandidateId;

-- Method 2: Only works in the newer versions of MySQL
SELECT name
FROM candidate
JOIN vote ON candidate.id = vote.CandidateId
GROUP BY CandidateId
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC
LIMIT 1;
