--Write an SQL query to find the person_name of the last person who will fit in the elevator without exceeding the weight limit. It is guaranteed that the person who is first in the queue can fit in the elevator.
--Method 1: without using window functions
select q1.person_name
from Queue as q1, Queue as q2
where q1.turn >= q2.turn
group by q1.turn, q1.person_name
having sum(q2.weight) <= 1000
order by sum(q2.weight) desc
limit 1;

--Method 2: using window functions
select sub.person_name from (select turn, person_name, sum(weight) over(order by turn) as 'max_weight'
from queue) as sub
where sub.max_weight<=1000
order by sub.max_weight desc limit 1;
