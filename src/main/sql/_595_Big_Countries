-- Write a SQL solution to output big countries' name, population and area.
-- Method 1: trivial
select name, population, area
from world
where area > 3000000
or population > 25000000;

-- Method 2: using Union (slightly faster than method 1)
select name, population, area
from world
where area > 3000000
UNION
select name, population, area
from world
where population > 25000000;
