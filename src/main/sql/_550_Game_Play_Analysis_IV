--Write an SQL query that reports the fraction of players that logged in again on the day after the day they first logged in, rounded to 2 decimal places.
--In other words, you need to count the number of players that logged in for at least two consecutive days starting from their first login date,
--then divide that number by the total number of players.

-- the sub query is to fetch all the players with the first / min event date and then join the main table to filter all the players who also have the event date next to their min date (consecutive event dates)
-- take care of sum and round functions
