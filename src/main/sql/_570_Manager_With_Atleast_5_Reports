-- Given the Employee table, write a SQL query that finds out managers with at least 5 direct reports
-- Sub query approach
SELECT Name
FROM Employee
WHERE Id IN (
SELECT ManagerId FROM Employee GROUP BY ManagerId HAVING COUNT(ManagerId) >=5
);

-- Method 2: Similar approach as 1, but just a different style of writing. Using a temporary table and a JOIN
SELECT Name
FROM Employee e1 JOIN (
SELECT ManagerId FROM Employee GROUP BY ManagerId HAVING COUNT(ManagerId) >=5
) as e2
ON e1.id = e2.ManagerId;

-- Method 3: Without using sub query. Self Join.
SELECT e1.Name
FROM employee e1
JOIN employee e2
ON e1.id = e2.ManagerId
GROUP BY e1.Name
HAVING count(*) >=5;
