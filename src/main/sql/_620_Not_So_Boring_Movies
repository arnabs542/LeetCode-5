-- please write a SQL query to output movies with an odd numbered ID and a description that is not 'boring'. Order the result by rating.
select id, movie, description, rating
from cinema
where id % 2 != 0 and description !='boring'
order by rating desc;

-- alternate way of getting odd numbers : using mod
select id, movie, description, rating
from cinema
where mod(id, 2)=1 and description !='boring'
order by rating desc;
