-- Could you help Tim by writing a query to judge whether these three sides can form a triangle, assuming table triangle holds the length of the three sides x, y and z.
select x, y, z,
	   CASE WHEN x + y <=z
			OR x + z <=y
            OR y + z <=x
			THEN 'No'
			ELSE 'Yes'
			END
			AS 'triangle'
from triangle;
