-- Query the customer_number from the orders table for the customer who has placed the largest number of orders.
-- Method 1: doesn't handle multiple customers with same highest orders
select sub.cust as customer_number
from (
      select customer_number as cust,
      count(*) as 'customer_number'
      from orders
      group by customer_number order by customer_number desc limit 1
      ) as sub;

-- Method 2 : without using limit. uses window functions
select customer_number
from (select customer_number, DENSE_RANK() over (order by count desc) as 'ranking'
      from (select customer_number, count(customer_number) as count from orders group by customer_number)sub1
      ) sub2
where sub2.ranking = 1;

-- Method 2: handles the follow up question: returns all the customers with highest orders
select customer_number
from orders
group by customer_number
having count(order_number) = (select count(*) as count
                              from orders

                              order by count desc limit 1);
