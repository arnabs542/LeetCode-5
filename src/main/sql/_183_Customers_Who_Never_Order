--Suppose that a website contains two tables, the Customers table and the Orders table. Write a SQL query to find all customers who never order anything.

SELECT cust.Name AS Customers
FROM Customers cust
LEFT JOIN Orders ord
ON cust.Id = ord.CustomerId
WHERE ord.Id IS NULL;

--Method 2: using NOT IN approach:
SELECT cust.Name as Customers
FROM Customers cust
WHERE cust.Id
NOT IN (SELECT CustomerId from Orders)
