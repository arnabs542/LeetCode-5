-- Write a query to print the respective department name and number of students majoring in each department for all departments in the department table (even ones with no current students).
-- Sort your results by descending number of students; if two or more departments have the same number of students, then sort those departments alphabetically by department name.

-- Method 1: Using the sub query approach / used the department table twice. Not an optimal approach
select dept.dept_name, COALESCE(sub.student_number, 0) as student_number
from (select student.dept_id, count(*) as student_number
      from department
      join student
      on department.dept_id=student.dept_id
      group by student.dept_id) as sub
right join department dept
on dept.dept_id = sub.dept_id
order by student_number desc, dept.dept_name;


-- Method 2: Using left join and without a sub query. Optimal
select dept_name, sum(case when stud.dept_id is NOT NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as student_number
from department dept
left join student stud
on dept.dept_id=stud.dept_id
group by dept_name
order by student_number desc, dept_name;
