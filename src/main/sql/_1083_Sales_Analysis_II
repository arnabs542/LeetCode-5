-- Write an SQL query that reports the buyers who have bought S8 but not iPhone. Note that S8 and iPhone are products present in the Product table.
-- Method 1: using having and case filters
select distinct buyer_id
from sales s
join product p
on s.product_id = p.product_id
group by buyer_id
having sum(case when p.product_name = 'S8' then 1 else 0 end) >= 1 and
	   sum(case when p.product_name = 'iPhone' then 1 else 0 end) = 0;


-- Method 2: using 2 queries and combining them as needed
select distinct s.buyer_id
from sales s
join product p
on s.product_id = p.product_id
where p.product_name = (select product_name
						from product
                        where product_name = 'S8')
and s.buyer_id not in (select distinct buyer_id
					   from sales s1
                       join product p1
                       on s1.product_id = p1.product_id
                       where product_name = 'iPhone');
