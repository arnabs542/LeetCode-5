--The Employee table holds all employees including their managers. Every employee has an Id, and there is also a column for the manager Id.
-- Method 1: using the correlated sub query approach
SELECT e1.name as Employee FROM employee e1 where e1.salary >
        (SELECT e2.salary
         FROM employee e2 where e1.ManagerId = e2.Id);

-- Method 2: using cross join and simple filters
SELECT e1.name AS Employee
FROM employee e1, employee e2
WHERE e1.ManagerId = e2.Id AND e1.Salary > e2.Salary;
