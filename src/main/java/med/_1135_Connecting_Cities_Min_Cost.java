 * You are given connections, where each connections[i] = [city1, city2, cost] represents the cost to connect city1 and city2 together.  (A connection is bidirectional: connecting city1 and city2 is the same as connecting city2 and city1
 * Return the minimum cost so that for every pair of cities, there exists a path of connections (possibly of length 1) that connects those two cities together.  The cost is the sum of the connection costs used. If the task is impossible, return -1.
