 * You work on a team whose job is to understand the most sought after toys for the holiday season. A teammate of yours has built a webcrawler that extracts a list of quotes about toys from different articles. You need to take these quotes and identify which toys are mentioned most frequently. Write an algorithm that identifies the top N toys out of a list of quotes and list of toys.
 * Your algorithm should output the top N toys mentioned most frequently in the quotes
